# SimpliSafe Plugin for IndigoDomo
This plugin **requires** that you have paid for the SimpliSafe "Interactive Alarm Monitoring" because it relies on the API that comes along with that.

**NOTE:** SimpliSafe does not provide any event based notification of when the Alarm state changes.  This plugin will update the state of the alarm when initiated by Indigo, but it will currently NOT reflect changes when they are initiated from other locations (like the keypad or mobile app)

## Device
There will be one device (alarm system) available with this plugin.  You are required to enter your SimpliSafe login information into the settings.

## Actions
There are three different SimpliSafe actions available to you:
* Arm SimpliSafe - Home
* Arm SimpliSafe - Away
* Disarm SimpliSafe

This plugin is still considered to be in a BETA stage.  Please feel free to provide comments.
